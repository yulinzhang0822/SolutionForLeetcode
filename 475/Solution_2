//he difficulty of this problem is to understand Math.abs(heaters[i] - house) >= Math.abs(heaters[i + 1] - house
//Let's us understand this with a example:
//houses: 1, 2, 3, 4
//heaters: 1, 4
//For house 1, heater 1 is closer to it than heater 4, so we don't move i to i + 1.
//For house 2, it is same. heater 1 is closer.
//For house 3, it is clear that heater 1 no longer closer, so we move i to i + 1.
//For house 4, continue....

            while (i < heaters.length - 1 && heaters[i] + heaters[i + 1] <= house * 2) {
                i++;
            }
